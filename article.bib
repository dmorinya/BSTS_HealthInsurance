Decedents comprised 5.9 percent of the study group but accounted for 28 percent of Medicare expenditures. The use of services became more intense as death approached. Despite the idea that heroic efforts to prolong life are common, only 6 percent of persons who died had more than \$15,000 in Medicare expenses in their last year of life. As shown here, the unique patterns of health care use by decedents and survivors should be fully understood and considered when contemplating changes in the Medicare program.},

	abstract = {This article describes a system for short term forecasting based on an ensemble prediction that averages over different combinations of predictors. The system combines a structural time series model for the target series with a regression component capturing the contributions of contemporaneous search query data. A spike-and-slab prior on the regression coefficients induces sparsity, dramatically reducing the size of the regression problem. Our system averages over potential contributions from a very large set of models and gives easily digested reports of which coefficients are likely to be important. We illustrate with applications to initial claims for unemployment benefits and to retail sales. Although our exposition focuses on using search engine data to forecast economic time series, the underlying statistical methods can be applied to more general short term forecasting with large numbers of contemporaneous predictors.},
